        <p>THE KING OF THE PLANETS</p>
        <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is best known for its colorful storms, the most famous being the Great Red Spot.</p>         
        <p>Now astronomers have focused on another beautiful feature of the planet, using the ultraviolet capabilities of NASA's Hubble Space 
        Telescope and supported by measurements made by NASA's Juno spacecraft.</p>        
        <p>The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM), captured views of Jupiter's north and south poles in infrared light, 
        revealing hot spots that had never been seen before.</p>
